# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Astro

When I was 14, I truly began exploring programming. Like many others, I started with HTML and CSS, which some might not consider "real" programming. Still, it's where I began, and it served as my entry point into the world of coding. 

By the time I turned 15, I ventured into PHP and Pocketmine. However, my attempts at developing plugins during that phase yielded little to no success. This setback pushed me to explore Java and Spigot, and surprisingly, things started to improve significantly. I quickly grasped the language and created my first small programs, which eventually led me deeper into Spigot development. From there, everything clicked, and my progress truly accelerated.

Now, at 22, I've built a wide range of systemsâ€”spanning from small projects to more complex solutions. One thing I've consistently learned throughout this journey is that programming always offers new knowledge and challenges, and even today, there's always something fresh to discover.
