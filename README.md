# Yo, I'm Astro ðŸ›¸

I've been messing with Minecraft Bedrock since I was like 14.  
Not just hosting a server, but really diving into it. Breaking it. Fixing it. Bending it.  
Now Iâ€™m 22, and somehow still doing it.

## What I actually build

I design and develop complete server architectures from the ground up.  
This includes both backend and frontend components, focusing on scalable, modular, and maintainable APIs.  
I implement core server systems that handle everything from player management to matchmaking and progression.
